## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-09

### üéØ Major Features Added
- **Task Stack Selection & Deletion**: Right-click on task stacks to select and delete entire groups of related tasks
- **Mixed Selection Support**: Select individual tasks and stacks simultaneously with accurate counting
- **Improved Stack Management**: Stacks remain collapsed during selection and deletion operations

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Stack Selection on App Startup**: Resolved issue where collapsed stacks couldn't be selected/deleted until expanded at least once

- **Fixed Stack Tracking Buttons**: Removed redundant tracking buttons from individual tasks inside stacks while keeping stack-level controls
- **Fixed Icon State Synchronization**: Resolved tracking button icons not switching between play/stop states correctly
- **Fixed Timer Conflicts**: Eliminated multiple timer intervals running simultaneously causing performance issues
- **Fixed Header Timer Sync**: Resolved header timer not updating when tracking was active

- **Optimized Task Lookup**: Stack selection now uses main task database instead of group cache for better reliability
- **Enhanced Event Handling**: Improved gesture event claiming to prevent conflicts between task and stack selections
- **Reduced Timer Overhead**: Consolidated multiple timer systems into single centralized tracking state manager

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced TaskRenderer Class**: Improved event isolation and gesture handling for both individual tasks and stacks
